Hello world! This is my first research entry.  This document is primarily going
to be dedicated to my thirst for knowledge, along with the occasional injection
of my opinions on things I either find incredibly enjoyable or demonstrably
lackluster in the fields of computer science. Although others may not read this,
I will attempt to make this enjoyable as I will still have to dredge through
this article at some point in time due to the influx of knowledge I hope to
attain.
