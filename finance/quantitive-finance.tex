\section{Interest Rates}

\begin{definition}
    A \emph{notional} or \emph{principal} is an initial deposit or value $N$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    \label{def:irate}
    An \emph{interest rate} $r$ is the rate at which a value is increased
    according to a specified frequency of time. 
\end{definition}

Suppose we have an account with interest rate $r$ and notional $N$. The value of 
the account at time $T$ is 
\begin{equation}
    N_T = Ne^{rT}
\end{equation}
Throughout finance, there exist discrete and continuous analogs for most
equations due the discrete case being more realistic while the  continuous case
is far more mathematically efficient. That being said, discrete analogs will be
used sparsely and we will primarily depend on continuous equations. The discrete
versions can be derived from the continuous versions by noting that
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:rtone}
    e^{rT} = {\left(1 + \frac{r_m}{m}\right)}^{mT}
\end{equation} where $T$ is commonly denoted as the time in years, $m$ is the
frequency the interest is compounded, and $r_m$ is the equivalent interest rate
with the discrete frequency. $r_m$ can then be recovered from $r$ using
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:rttwo}
    r_m = m\left(e^{\left(\frac{r}{m}\right)} - 1\right).
\end{equation}

\begin{definition}
    A \emph{money market account} is an account compounded continuously at rate
    $r$ with notional 1. I.e. $M_0 = 1$ and $M_{t} = e^{rt}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    A \emph{zero coupon bond} (ZCB) with maturity $T$ is an asset that pays 1 at
    time $T$ (and nothing else). The value of a ZCB at time $t$ for a
    continuously compounded rate $r$ is denoted as 
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:zcb}
        Z(t, T) = e^{-r(T-t)}
    \end{equation} where $Z(T, T) = 1$ by definition.     
    The values $Z(t, T)$ with $0 \leq t \leq T$ are known as \emph{discount
    factors} or \emph{present values}.
\end{definition}

The intuition behind the present values for a ZCB derives from the fact that if
we have two portfolios, one a ZCB with maturity $T$ and another that contains
cash which will accumulate interest to be worth 1 at time $T$, then both will be
worth the same value at each $t$ leading up to $T$ and thereafter.

\begin{definition}
    An \emph{annuity} a series of fixed cashflows at specified times $T_i = 1,
    \dots, n$. The value at time $t$ is given by 
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:annuity}
        V = C\sum_{i = 1}^n Z(t, T_i).
    \end{equation}
\end{definition}
When we substitute in \refeq{zcb}, we notice that this is just a geometric
series. Because of this, if an annuity is payed once a year for $M$ years with
rate $r$, this
equates to 
\begin{equation}
    V = \sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{1}{{(1 + r)}^i} = \frac{1}{r}\left(1 - \frac{1}{{(1 + r)}^M}\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{definition}
    The \emph{accrual factor} is (under the discrete analogy) the frequency
    which interest is compounded, and is denoted as $\alpha$.
\end{definition}

\begin{table}[t]
    \centering
    \caption{Daycount conventions and accrual factors}
    \label{tab:dccon}
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Daycount convention} & \textbf{$\alpha$ for 16 December 2011 -
        16 March 2012} \\
        \midrule
        act/365 & 91/365 \\
        act/act & 15/365 + 76/366 \\
        act/360 & 91/360 \\
        30/365 & 1/4 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In Equations~\ref{eq:rtone} and~\ref{eq:rttwo}, this is the same as taking
$\alpha = 1/m$. Due to the year being uneasily divided by simple values of
$\alpha$, several \emph{daycount conventions} have been made for different
settings. We list these in Table~\ref{tab:dccon}. The daycount conventions are
seemingly deceptive in that they hide various details behind terminology. For
example, two cases are 30/x and x/360, which respectively denote that each month
in the period should be counted as only having 30 days and each month in a year
should be counted as only having 30 days. I want to emphasize the weird
convention because when we encounter a fraction in the work such as 30/act, this
means to say that if we specify a period of three months, then this fraction
actually denotes 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{30 * 3}{m_1 + m_2 + m_3}
\end{equation} where each $m_i$ is the number of actual days in the specified
month. Like wise, if we have a daycount act/act, this denotes the number specifies
the number of actual days in the period divided by the actual days in the year.
If we have a leap year, then the denominator contains 366, whereas if February
is included in the daycount, then we may have 28 or 29 days dependent on the
year. I hope this helps to explain it better, if not then \emph{oof}.

A few specific cases arise but are only defined in the exercises. I will list
those here.

\begin{definition}
    \emph{Semi-bond} is the US dollar interest rate which is semi-annual
    compounding with 30/360 daycount and is denoted as $\gamma_{SB}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    \emph{Annual money} is the US dollar interest rate which is annual
    compounding with act/360 daycount and is denoted as $\gamma_{AM}$.
\end{definition}

If we know the rate $r_{\alpha}$ and accrual factor $\alpha$ of a quoted
interest rate over a specified period of time, and we are interested in the
equivalent rate $r_\beta$ under a different accrual factor $\beta$ over the same
period of time, then this information can be retrieved by making note of the
equivalency 
\begin{equation}
    r_\alpha\alpha = r_\beta\beta.
\end{equation} This makes conversions simple as demonstrated by the following
example. 

\begin{example}
    If on 16 December 2011 the act/365 rate for three months is $5\%$, the
    act/360 rate is 
    \begin{equation}
        r_\beta = r_\alpha\frac{\alpha}{\beta} = 5\% \frac{\text{act/365}}
        {\text{act/360}} = 5\%\frac{360}{365} = 4.9315\%.
    \end{equation}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    The conversion between semi-bonds and annual money is given by 
    \begin{equation}
        \gamma_{SB}\frac{30}{360} = \gamma_{AM}\frac{\text{act}}{360},
    \end{equation}
    so that 
    \begin{equation}
        \gamma_{SB} = \gamma_{AM}\frac{\text{act}}{30},
    \end{equation} and likewise
    \begin{equation}
        \gamma_{AM} = \gamma_{SB}\frac{30}{\text{act}}.
    \end{equation}
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
    A \emph{stock} or \emph{share} is an asset giving ownership in a fraction of
    a company. The price at time $t$ of a stock is denoted by $S_t$. The current
    known price is called the \emph{spot}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    A \emph{fixed rate bond} with coupon $c$ and notional $N$ is an asset that
    pays a coupon $cN$ at a specified frequency (usually a year) and $N$ at its
    maturity date $T$. A \emph{floating rate bond} is defined similarly with a
    variable interest rate.
\end{definition}
